## About this project
I don't develop this project any more and therefore it is now also open source. If someone would like to develop this project further he should do this gladly and then I would be happy if he would create an pull-request.

# Important
It is important that you enter your [bottoken](https://discordapp.com/developers) in the file KEYS.py, otherwise the bot will not work.
